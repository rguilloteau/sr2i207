#SR2I207 2019 - BadUSB
## Presentation
There are two types of attacks develloped here.
1. The first one is a RickRoll attack. It is a good joke to do to a friend. It plays [Never gonna give you up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) forever and forces the volume to 100%. The only solution is to go the task manager to kill both processes. A possible improvement is to add a press on ESCAPE key in the script which press VOLUME UP in a loop.

2. The second is a more serious attack which gives a administrator reverse shell to the attacker.

## Requirements
Those programs work only on Arduino compatible with `Keyboard.h` library like Arduino Leonardo, Micro or Due for instance.
